    <h3> What I Learned / What I'd Like to Learn</h3>
    <hr>

    <p> <strong>I have never used HTML or GitHub before so I actually have learned a lot so far. </strong> I learned how to show an image from another website. How to add lists and put circles or squares in front of each word. I have also learned how to put a link on my webpage and how to change the color of certain text. GitHub I still don't have a great grasp on but I did learn about Repositories and how to look at what I've changed on my webpage. In terms of what I would like to learn, I would like to figure out why some images don't work when trying to put them on my page. I would also like to learn how to create multiple pages on my webpage and how to create a search feature. </p>
